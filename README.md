OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:

TASK ONE: PASSWORD STRENGTH CHECKER
Developing a tool to assess the strength of passwords entered by users. Implement
algorithms to analyze factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness to provide
feedback on password strength.

To develop a password strength checker as a cyber security project, we can implement a tool that evaluates the strength of passwords based on various factors, 
such as length, complexity, and uniqueness. 

Factors Considered:
Length: Minimum length required.
Complexity: The presence of lowercase, uppercase, digits, and special characters.
Uniqueness: The absence of repeated characters or sequences.
Common Patterns: Avoiding common passwords

Explanation:
Length Check: The password must be at least 8 characters long.
Complexity Check: The password must contain at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special character.
Uniqueness Check: The password must have more than 70% unique characters.
Common Patterns Check: The password must not be among a list of commonly used weak passwords.
